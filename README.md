# passion-stats-python

Jupyter notebooks designed to teach the [Passion Driven Statistics](https://passiondrivenstatistics.wescreates.wesleyan.edu) curriculum at Ca√±ada College. The PDS curriculum is used in an Introductory Statistics course for students without much coding or mathematics preperation. The notebooks are designed to be easily editable and kept in a specific order to keep students from issues with out-of-order execution. 

All of the notebooks were originally written by David Monarres and contributions are welcome.
